This is a tiny local multiplayer game in which you control pirateships that fight to the death in various gamemodes. There are a couple of learning goals for this project:
- Working splitscreen support
- Finishing a game for once
- Joystick support, currently supports hot plugging of Xbox ONE controllers.
